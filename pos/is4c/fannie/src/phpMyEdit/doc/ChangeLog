+-+-+-+-+ Changes by Jim Kraai & John McCreesh follow

2002-02-07
	Added support for $fdd['field']['values']['db']
	Replace call to mysql_fetch_assoc with mysql_fetch_array in PME Setup
05-Feb-02
	Tore explicit date support from PME out of frustration
	(will tackle this later)
	timestamps are still read-only

04-Feb-02
	Fixed logtable schema in PHPMyEditSetup.php

30-Jan-02
	Changed filters to use strings instead of arrays

29-Jan-02
	Added support for $fdd[col][values]['filters'] when selecting
	  values from another table
	Added support for 'graphic' links

28-Jan-02
	Added ability to turn off displaying current sort and/or filters
	  in generated include file
	Added nowrap to action (first) column if 'link' style is used

25-Jan-02
	Added support for MySQL enum type
	Added support for MySQL set type
	Fixed bug with sort field number zero
	Fixed bug in PME Setup w/ wrong name to support language labels
	  in generated .inc file
	Fixed bug in PME Setup where generated file was including non-existent
	  header/footer files
	Added support in PME Setup for default values MySQL derived
	  from MySQL table description
	Fixed date edit form display bug
	Added another action--Display Detail.
	In $opts['options'], it's an 'E' and is on by default

24-Jan-02 - 4.001b1 Many Changes
	Added support for a calculated column requires:
		$fdd['other']['name']='Col Header';
		$fdd['other']['expression']='onHand-ordered';
		$fdd['other']['sort']='T:!';
		$fdd['other']['select']='T';
		$fdd['other']['type']='int';
		'other' can be anything, but multiple ones in a single
		       file need to be unique
		'expression' can be any valid MySQL expression
		'type' should reflect the results of the expression,
		       e.g. 'int' or 'string'
		all other options work as with other, normal columns
		this kind of column is always read-only
    Most of these changes were motivated by using PME in two 
    medium sized projects.
    Setup renamed to PHPMyEditSetup.php
    Setup Added functionality:
    Ascertains field type from mysql database
    Setup displays and attempts to write two files.
    These files are written to a configurable directory.
    PHPMyEdit.inc Added functionality:
    Date and Number filter fields now have in/equality operators
    Major date handling changes:
      Dates now handled with multiple input fields
      Specifiable date ranges (within year ranges only)
	  see 'daterange' option
        
    Can set listing limit to -1 (all rows on page)
    Can have multiple initial sort fields which are retained
	  as secondary/tertiary/quaternary/etc sort fields during normal usage
    'format' option is deprecated in favor of two new options:
        'datemask' is a PHP date style date format that supports
		           a few of the date macros
        'mask' is processed by printf() before displaying
    'daterange' accepts a range of years
    'maxwidth' is a new option that limits the width of filter fields
    'URL' options have been expanded, maybe too far for security comfort
    'options' have been expanded to recognize additional params
        R -- read-only
        P -- password field
        H -- hidden field
    Not for the faint of heart, trigger support has been added,
	see discussion in home page docs.
	Initial filters capability has been added, also not for the faint
	  of heart. Flexibility was chosen at the cost of ease of use
    Default field values are now supported
    Updates to a table can now be logged to another table
	Call to $MyForm -> execute() moved to end of the PME class initializer
	  because it always gets executed then anyway
	Previously unidentified bug fixed where if the coder had referred
	  to the same ['values']['table'] for two different fields would pull
	  (and update) based on the last use of the referenced table.
	  Changed all implicit joins to LEFT OUTER JOINs.
    Bug fix where addslashes() wasn't complimented by strip
    Bug fix where filtering didn't work where there were slashes
	in the data
    Started moving to single function which generates SELECT statements

06-May-01 - 3.5 multilingual version - you can now change all
    the displayed text to your local language. 
    Limited ability to customise the format used for displaying and 
    entering dates (d/m/y, m/d/y, d.m.y etc). However, dates in filters
    must still be entered in MySQL format.
    Fixed some bugs introduced when support of column names containing
    special characters or reserved words was added (e.g. using 'Date' as
    a column name). Note - database and table names may not contain
    special characters or reserved words.
    Changed handling of 'Cancel' button
	(thanks Bret <mogul@gealtinous.com>)

23-Apr-01 - 3.4 added 'More' button to 'Add' screen to make it easier
    to enter multiple records.

23-Apr-01 - 3.3 fixed bug which prevented 'Next' button working
    when filter had been activated (oops).

18-Apr-01 - 3.2 added ['select'] = 'M' to allow Multiple values
    to be selected in a drop-down list in a filter. The number of values
	displayed is set by $multiple (default = 4).

    NOTE - $multiple has been added to the call to PHPMyEdit, so this
    release is not compatible with calling programs produced by earlier
    releases of SETUP.PHP (sorry).

20-Mar-01 - 3.1 added ['options'] to provide full control over
    which fields appear on the List, Add, Change, and Delete screens.
	This replaces 'listview', which no longer works with this release
	- i.e. ['options']='ACD' has the same effect as ['listview']=true.

27-Feb-01 - 3.0 PHPMyEdit converted to PHP classes
    by Pau Aliagas <pau@newtral.com>.
    This new version will not work with calling programs created by older
    versions of SETUP.PHP - you will need to run SETUP.PHP again (sorry).
    Added $options='I'  - to display records from the table with the
    Initial sort suppressed (useful if you have a very large table with 
    no indexes).

14-Feb-01 - 2.3 added ['description'] option to ['values']. 
    This considerably enhances PHPMyEdit's ability to handle multiple
	tables in a seamless manner. It also involved a lot of new code,
	so 2.3 should be considered as more risky than the well-tested 2.2.

10-Feb-01 - 2.2 generate javascript to ensure user enters values
    for fields marked as 'required'. SETUP.PHP now marks 'not_null'
	fields as 'required' by default.
	(by Yusuf Kursat Tuncel <kursat@ttnet.net.tr>)
    PHPMyEdit.PHP now no longer requires 'sort_open_tag' to be set to
    false.

    NOTE - to use the filter functionality, you must now have 'F' in
    $OPTIONS in your calling program. This is set automatically by
    SETUP.PHP in version 2.2, BUT IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE (sorry).

02-Feb-01 - 2.1 suppress display of selected fields from the list
    display but still allow editing with "listview" property.
	(by Linas Jakucionis <linas@rl.lt>)

12-Jan-01 - 2.0 added filter functionality based on an idea from Chris.

02-Jan-00 - 1.9 fixed minor bug in display of blank fields as textareas

21-Dec-00 - 1.8 clicking a second time on a column heading causes
    the sort order to be reversed
	(thanks to Paolo Petrini <paolo.petrini@gib.it>)
    Support multi-line textareas (thanks again to Chris Navas)

19-Dec-00 - 1.7 removed restriction that key field must be numeric
    with $key_type parameter. Also fixed that not all browsers let you
	get away with <input disabled...>.

17-Dec-00 - 1.6 split out php and php3 versions. 
    SETUP.PHP now prompts for the field to be used as a key. 
    PHPMyEdit can now populate drop down lists from a field in a table.

11-Dec-00 - 1.5 included a local version of an in_array function
    so PHP Version 3 users can use the program
	(thanks to <ivo@ibuildings.nl> for the code).

10-Dec-00 - 1.4 Added support for textareas to SETUP.PHP and PHPMyEdit.
    Merci beaucoup Chris Navas <chris@arbo.com> pour ce petit truc.

08-Dec-00 - 1.3 SETUP is now a bit prettier to look at. PHPMyEdit.PHP
    now allows you to store HTML etc inside a table (previously it
	stripped out anything that looked like code). Note that it displays
	HTML as HTML - e.g. if you store <b>this</b> in a table, that's how
	it will appear on the screen - not 'this' in bold type.

03-Dec-00 - 1.2 rather more elegant solution to SETUP.PHP problem already
    fixed temporarily in 1.1.
    Added warning to SETUP.PHP if PHP is not configured correctly for XML.
    Added support for "URL" parameter to SETP.PHP and PHPMyEdit.PHP, 
    to allow 'clickable' links to email, web, ftp, etc. addresses.
    Improved handling of magic_quotes within PHPMyEdit.PHP.

29-Nov-00 - 1.1 temporary fix to glaring bug which prevented SETUP.PHP
    working with protected MySQL databases
