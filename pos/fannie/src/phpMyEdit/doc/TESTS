If you have some time, I will appreciate if you could perform some tests to
ensure that phpMyEdit is working right with every table.

[1] Access generated script. Press "Search". Remember number of displayed
records and the whole look of the page. Now press "Query". The page should look
the same (of course except thing, that filter is opened) and the number of
displayed record should not change.

[2] Ensure you have $opts['display']['query'] enabled. Access generated script.
Make some filtering. Click on the "Clear" link in the query line. You will be
purpously moved to the first page. Click on the "Next". You should get the page
no. 2.
